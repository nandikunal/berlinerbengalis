      </h3>
      <p>Berliner Bengalis (Berlin er bangali) is a group of Bengalis that started
        it&#39;s journey in 2023. Sanatani way of life is very close to our heart and we
        are deeply rooted to it&#39;s values and rituals.</p>
      <p>Berlin is for us &quot;home away from home&quot;. Berlin is a city that is very much
        known for it&#39;s multicultural existence. We as a sanatani group, would like
        to contribute to that with our cultural practices for us and the generations
        to come.</p>
      <p>Alongside Sanatani practices, we would also focus on rituals around
        Bengali culture and most importantly something for the preservation of
        nature which we consider as &quot;Mother Earth&quot; as per tradition.</p>
      <p>We strongly believe that, culture and social responsibilities go hand in
        hand. Practising Hindu Sanatani Culture through different activities and
        save the nature through creating awareness is our moto.</p>
      </p>

      <h4>Durga Puja</h4>
      <p>Durga Puja is a major Hindu festival celebrated primrily among Sanatani
        Hindus in India and in other parts of the world with Bengali communities.
        The essence of Goddess Durga embodies strength, courage, and
        protection. She is believed to symbolize the divine feminine energy that
        can overcome and conquer any negative forces or challenges in life.
        Durga represents the power to stand up against injustice and to
        vanquish evil, ultimately restoring harmony and righteousness. Her story
        and attributes inspire devotion, resilience, and the belief in the triumph of
        good over evil.
        According to Hindu mythological practices, the worship of goddess
        Durga is being practiced twice in a year.
        Basanti Puja also known as Chaitra Durga Puja is celebrated during
        Indian Hindu calendar month of Chaitra, Bosonto Kaal or the spring
        season.
        And,

        Akaal Bodhan or Sarodiya Durga Puja is celebrated in the Indian Hindu
        calendar month of  Ashwin , which corresponds to September – October
        in the  Gregorian calendar .
        Basanti Puja is celebrated widely among Indian Sanatani Hindus but
        Akaal Bodhan or Sarodiya Durga Puja is practiced and celebrated in a
        much greater way.</p>

      <h4>Etymology of Akaal Bodhan</h4>
      <p>Both the words Akaal and Bodhan descendant from  Sanskrit
        word akālabodhana , which are also included in many other languages,
        such as  Bengali ,  Assamese ,  Odia  and other languages of  Bay of
        Bengal . The word Akaal means untimed (kaal=time and a=not) and the
        word Bodhan means worship or invocation. Thus, Akaal Bodhan means
        worship or invocation of  Durga  in an uncustomary time. It is given this
        name since the period of this worship differs from the conventional
        period, which is during the spring (Vasanta).

        There are many mythological believes and stories as per Sanatani Hindu
        religion behind the reason of celebration of Akaal Bodhan or Sarodiya
        Durga Puja.</p>

      <h4>One of them as follows</h4>
      <p>The reference to Akaal Bodhan is found in the Mahabhagavata Purana.
        According to this Purana, when Ravana awakened Kumbhakarna and
        sent him to the war, Rama was terrified. Then Brahma assured Rama
        and told him to worship Goddess Durga (Mahabhagavat 41.22-33) for
        success on the battlefield. Rama told Brahma that this was not the
        proper time (Akaal) to worship the Goddess as this was Krishnapaksha
        and it is time for her sleep. Then Brahma said that on behalf of Rama,
        he will perform the Bodhana and the Puja. Rama agreed and appointed
        Brahma as the Purohita (priest) (Mahabhagavata 42.12-27). Brahma
        agreed to be his purohit and perform the puja from Krishna Navami till
        the death of the Ravana (Shukla Navami)(Mahabhagavata 43.81-97).
        Following the instruction of Brahma, Rama praised the Goddess by

        uttering Katyanai Stab (Mahabhagavata 44.1-17). Brahma himself
        uttered the Devi Sukta from the Vedas to please the Goddess
        (Mahabhagavata 45.4-19). Devi was pleased and she appeared and
        said that there will be a great war between Rama and Ravana between
        Shukla Saptami to Shukla Navami. On Saptami, she will enter into
        Rama&#39;s bow and arrows. During the time when Ashtami tithi will end and
        Navami will start in that juncture (Sandhi) she will cut Ravana&#39;s heads
        one after another. And finally, she assured that in the afternoon on
        Shukla Navami tithi, she will destroy Ravana completely
        (Mahabhagavata 45.20-43).</p>

      <h4>Durga Puja 2023</h4>
      <p>During Durga puja, elaborate and artistic idols of Goddess Durga are
        crafted and installed in beautifully decorated pandals (temporary
        structures). Devotees offer prayers, perform traditional rituals, and enjoy
        cultural performances, including music and dance. It&#39;s a time of joy,
        feasting, and a strong sense of community.
        The festival holds immense cultural and religious significance among
        Sanatani Hindus and is celebrated with great enthusiasm and grandeur,
        attracting devotees and tourists from all over the world.
        We, Berliner Bengalis remains connected with our Sanatani Hindu
        practices and will celebrate Durga Puja in 2023.
        We will conduct Durga Puja at Radha Govinda Temple, Berlin as per the
        schedule of Panjika from 20th October 2023 (Sasthi) till 24th October
        2023 (Dashami).
        At the same time, we strongly believe that we need to save our mother
        nature so that, we can sustain in this universe. And, we are going to
        demonstrate this message in Berlin through the worship of Maa Durga.
        Our theme represents ´Save the Nature´. According to our theme ´Save
        the Nature´, the Idol of Maa Durga is represented.
        Since we are expecting an immense crowd during the festivities of
        Durga Puja 2023, we hope &#39;Save the Nature&#39; concept will reach among
        people in and around Berlin, Germany.</p>
