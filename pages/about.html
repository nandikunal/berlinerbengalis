      </h3>
      <p>Berliner Bengalis e.V. (Berlin er Bangali) is a registered non-profitable and non-commercial association of Bengalis that began its journey in 2023. The Sanatani way of life is very dear to us, and we are deeply rooted in its values and rituals. Berlin feels like our "home away from home," and as a city known for its multicultural fabric, we wish to enrich this diversity with our cultural practices, preserving them for ourselves and future generations.</p>
      <p>Alongside our Sanatani traditions, we are committed to celebrating Bengali culture and emphasizing the importance of environmental conservation, which we honor as the protection of "Mother Earth" according to our traditions.</p>
      <p>We firmly believe that cultural expression and social responsibility go hand in hand. Our mission is to practice and promote the Hindu Sanatani culture through various activities, while also raising awareness about the need to protect our natural environment. By doing so, we hope to inspire others to appreciate and preserve the world we all share.</p>
      <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Traditions & Practices</h3>
      <h4><strong>Durga Puja</strong></h4>
      <p>Durga Puja is a major Hindu festival celebrated primarily by Sanatani Hindus in India and Bengali communities worldwide. Goddess Durga embodies strength, courage, and protection, representing the divine feminine energy that triumphs over negativity and injustice. Her story inspires devotion, resilience, and the belief in the victory of good over evil.</p>
      <p>Durga is worshipped twice a year in Hindu tradition:</p>
      <ul>
          <li><strong>Basanti Puja (Chaitra Durga Puja)</strong>: Celebrated during the Chaitra month in spring.</li>
          <li><strong>Akaal Bodhan (Sarodiya Durga Puja)</strong>: Celebrated in the Ashwin month, corresponding to September-October.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>While Basanti Puja is observed widely among Sanatani Hindus, Akaal Bodhan or Sarodiya Durga Puja is celebrated on a much larger scale.</p>
      <h4><strong>Etymology of Akaal Bodhan</strong></h4>
      <p>The words <strong>Akaal</strong> and <strong>Bodhan</strong> originate from the Sanskrit term <strong>akālabodhana</strong>, and are used in several languages, including Bengali, Assamese, Odia, and other languages spoken around the Bay of Bengal. <strong>"Akaal"</strong> translates to "untimed" (with <strong>"kaal"</strong> meaning time and <strong>"A"</strong> meaning not), while <strong>"Bodhan"</strong> means "worship" or "invocation." Together, <strong>Akaal Bodhan</strong> refers to the worship or invocation of Goddess Durga at an unconventional time.</p>
      <p>This term is used because the worship takes place during the autumn month of Ashwin, rather than the traditional spring (Vasanta) season.</p>
      <p>There are various mythological beliefs and stories in Sanatani Hindu tradition that explain the origins and reasons behind the celebration of Akaal Bodhan, also known as Sarodiya Durga Puja.</p>
      <h4><u>Reference to <strong>Akaal Bodhan</strong> in the Mahabhagavata Purana</u></h4>
      <ul>
        <p>The reference to <strong>Akaal Bodhan</strong> is found in the <em>Mahabhagavata Purana</em>. According to this Purana, when Ravana awakened Kumbhakarna and sent him to war, Rama was terrified. Brahma then assured Rama and instructed him to worship Goddess Durga for success on the battlefield (Mahabhagavat 41.22-33). Rama replied that it was not the proper time (Akaal) for worship, as it was Krishna Paksha and the time for the Goddess’s rest. Brahma offered to perform the worship on Rama’s behalf. Rama agreed and appointed Brahma as the purohita (priest) (Mahabhagavata 42.12-27).</p>
        <p>Brahma agreed to perform the puja from Krishna Navami until Ravana's death (Shukla Navami) (Mahabhagavata 43.81-97). Following Brahma’s instructions, Rama praised the Goddess by reciting the Katyanai Stab (Mahabhagavata 44.1-17). Brahma himself recited the Devi Sukta from the Vedas to please the Goddess (Mahabhagavata 45.4-19).</p>
        <p>The Goddess was pleased and declared that a great battle between Rama and Ravana would occur from Shukla Saptami to Shukla Navami. On Saptami, she would enter Rama’s bow and arrows. During the juncture of Ashtami ending and Navami beginning (Sandhi), she would sever Ravana’s heads one after another. She assured that by the afternoon of Shukla Navami, she would completely destroy Ravana (Mahabhagavata 45.20-43).</p>
      </ul>

      <h3 class="w3-border-bottom w3-border-light-grey w3-padding-16">Durga Puja Timeline</h3>
      <p>
      During Durga Puja, beautifully crafted and elaborate idols of Goddess Durga are installed in intricately decorated pandals (temporary structures). Devotees come together to offer prayers, perform traditional rituals, and enjoy vibrant cultural performances, including music and dance. It’s a time of joy, feasting, and a deep sense of community. This festival holds profound cultural and religious significance among Sanatani Hindus and is celebrated with great enthusiasm and grandeur, attracting devotees and tourists from around the world.
